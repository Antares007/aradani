Mastering time management skills to grow your business
January 21, 2019 Nicole Ortiz

When deadlines are approaching, it can feel like there just aren’t
enough hours in the day to accomplish everything that needs to get done.
And sure, it’d be nice if we could snap our fingers and add a couple
extra hours here and there, but the best (and most practical)
thing you can do to keep yourself on track is to focus on how
you spend your time.

So here are a few tips to help creators master time management.

Set specific timelines
By giving yourself realistic and specific timelines (ex. “I want to
meet X goal by this Friday” vs. “I’ll grow my business substantially
this year”), you’ll be able to work toward that goal mindfully while
also keeping your procrastination in check. Sending out an email to
your audience on Friday? Break it down into manageable steps: draft
on Monday, edit on Tuesday, format on Wednesday, test on Thursday,
send on Friday. Mapping out a course of small, actionable steps can
keep large, looming project from becoming overwhelming.

Remove distractions (when they’re too distracting)
We all procrastinate, and sometimes that free space to think can be
beneficial to your creative flow. Maybe scrolling mindlessly through
Instagram is exactly what you needed to spark an idea or complete your
train of thought. It’s when procrastination starts to negatively affect
your workflow (causing you to miss deadlines or decrease your quality
of work) that it becomes a problem. Tasking out your project in small,
manageable steps will help you avoid falling down that procrastination
rabbit hole. You’ll be able to notice yourself falling behind as soon
as it happens and remove any distractions that are holding you back,
which is a lot better than realizing your final deadline is hours away
and you’re still far from finished. 

Play to your strengths
You know yourself best. If you’re not a morning person, you’re going
to have a tough time peeling yourself out of bed at the crack of dawn.
So don’t force it. Figure out what time of day you feel your sharpest
and make your schedule around that. Whether that’s 5 a.m. or 11 p.m.,
just mark off that chunk of time in your calendar and find yourself a
space where you can focus.

Avoid multitasking
It may seem a bit counterintuitive (working faster is a good thing,
right?), but often when you’re multitasking, you’re spreading yourself
too thin and not doing your best work. By designating specific parts
of your day to different tasks, like a segmented time for checking and
responding to emails, you’ll be able to cut down on distractions.

Write up a schedule using verbs to start every task so there’s no
guessing or deliberating when you come to your next item. Instead of
plugging in “EMAIL” in your calendar for 11 a.m., enter: “write draft
of email to community announcing tour dates.” This way your brain will
know exactly what to do.

Save the best for last
One way to keep yourself motivated is to get your most dreaded tasks
out of the way first, and keep the most exciting parts of what you do
for later. Think about it this way: if you save the difficult or more
boring tasks to knock out on Friday, you’ll just be hung up on them all
week long. But, if you get those not-so-fun projects off your plate on
Monday or Tuesday, you’ll feel way less stressed about the week ahead.
Plus, by checking something tough off your list so early on, you’ll set
the tone for a great week.
